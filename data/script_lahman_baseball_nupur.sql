--4.Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery". Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.

SELECT
CASE 
   WHEN pos = 'OF' THEN 'outfield'
   WHEN pos IN ('SS','1B','2B','3B') THEN 'infield'
   WHEN pos IN ('P','C') THEN 'Battery'
   END AS position, 
   SUM(po) AS total_putouts
FROM fielding
WHERE yearid= '2016'
GROUP BY position
